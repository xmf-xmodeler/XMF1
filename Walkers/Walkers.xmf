      The Walkers package defines the abstract class Walker and a number
      of useful instances and extensions. An element walker is used to walk
      an arbitrary value and perform a task. The walker will handle cycles in
      the structure of the element. For example, a walker may be used to search
      a value, or collect information about its contents.
