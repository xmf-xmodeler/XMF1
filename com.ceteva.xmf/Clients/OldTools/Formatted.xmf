  @Class Formatted isabstract
  
    @Doc
      An instance of this class is a type definition for a container of 
      display elements. In an instanc of the type, the display elements 
      are formatted using a layout manager. The layout manager can use
      the value of the enumerated type layout to control how the contained
      elements are displayed. The value of layout should be one of:
      VERTICAL for layout along the y-axis; HORIZONTAL for layout along
      the x-axis; OVERLAY for elements on top of each other.
    end 
  
    @Attribute layout  : String        = "VERTICAL"              end
    @Attribute manager : LayoutManager = StandardLayoutManager() end
     
    @Operation layout(object,x,y,width,height)
    
      // A formatted type can be asked to layout an instance of itself.
      // The default behaviour is to hand over layout control to the
      // layout manager.
    
     self.manager.layout(self,object,x,y,width,height)
      
    end
