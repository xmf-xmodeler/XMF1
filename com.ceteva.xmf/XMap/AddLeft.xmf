  @Class AddLeft extends AddAction
  
    @Doc
      The AddLeft construct occurs in a SyncContainers construct and is used to
      define a daemon that fires when an element is added to the left container
      of the two being synchronized. If the left handl container is updated
      with one or more values then this daemon is fired for each new element.
      The construct has a parameter which is bound to the value which is added.
      In the body of the daemon the value of 'self' is the object being updated
      (i.e. the container). All other scoping rules apply.
      
      Constructor: AddLeft(arg,body)
      
    end
       
    //@SyncContainers(Class,constraints,myObj,sneaky)
    //  @AddLeft(constraint)
    //    // Every time anyone adds a constraint to Class
    //    // squirrel it away in MyClass.
    //    if not sneaky->includes(constraint)
    //    then myObj.sneaky := sneaky->prepend(constraint)
    //    end
    //  end
    //end
